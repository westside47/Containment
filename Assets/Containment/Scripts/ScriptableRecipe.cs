// Saves the crafting recipe info in a ScriptableObject that can be used ingame
// by referencing it from a MonoBehaviour. It only stores static data.
//
// We also add each one to a dictionary automatically, so that all of them can
// be found by name without having to put them all in a database. Note that we
// have to put them all into the Resources folder and use Resources.LoadAll to
// load them. This is important because some recipes may not be referenced by
// any entity ingame. But all recipes should still be loadable from the
// database, even if they are not referenced by anyone anymore. So we have to
// use Resources.Load. (before we added them to the dict in OnEnable, but that's
// only called for those that are referenced in the game. All others will be
// ignored be Unity.)
//
// A Recipe can be created by right clicking the Resources folder and selecting
// Create -> uSurvival Recipe. Existing recipes can be found in the Resources
// folder.
