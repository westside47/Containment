Character ideas (satyrical versions of real people in history) :

C - Astra (sun/star)

W - Leonidas (spartan)

W - Kusunoki (samurai)

E - Oymyakon (frost)

E - Nikola (lightning)

P - Nostradamus (plague doctor)
	-smell the flowers
	-bloodletting (on enemy)
	-leeches

P - Combat Medic

Environments (designed similar to WoW arenas with different high/low ground and terrain advantages):
	-Waves will rotate through different armor types
	-Each environment will have a unique strength/weakness (water taking extra lightning damage)

	-Water - on an island - waves spawn 360 degrees from the sea around you. Minimal terrain objects.
		- tides come in/out minimizing/expanding playable space

	-Magic - physical/bleed advantage

	-Physical - in a castle - magic advantage

	-Hell - physicians/light advantage

	-Laboratory - cosmologist advantage
		-Traps, elevators/pits




-Potentially break characters into categories like tank, healer, dps, etc.
	*Saviors
		*Field of Expertise
		-Combat Specialists (physical/melee) - tank/bleed/threat - physical damage
		-Elementalists (frost/fire/lightning/earth/air) - buffs/debuffs - elemental damage
		-Cosmologists (stars, gravity, time) - combination of elemental/physical damage
		-Physicians (healers)
		-Tacticians (mines, traps, artillery) - utility - combination of elemental/physical damage

-Premise
	-Earth has been attacked by dark magic, altering life and making nature hostile. 
		Bringing back disfigured/magic versions of life on earth
	-Humans figured out how to harness the magic to bring back historical figures and infuse them with the dark magic
		to combat the hostile life
	-Earth/plants/animals/reanimates all locked on island, must reach portal that takes them to other points on earth to spread.
		Don't let waves reach portal.


-More ways to get gold than getting the last hit on creeps
-Abilities/items scale by % rather than flat numbers to ensure scalability
-Different environments (10) that can be chosen in any order from start. 
	-After defeating an environment you can choose the next
	-Each next environment scales like m+ in wow (health and damage % increases)
	-Potentially introduce rotating affixes (monthly/quarterly/seasonally)
-Unlock levels based on highest completed. Able to then start climbing from any level unlocked.
-Allowed to switch characters within category, but not switch categories (switch between Elementalists like frost to fire, 
	but not Elementalist to Cosmologist) - This keeps items relevant level to level as they scale within each field                                            
-Allowed to have multiple members of party playing in same category, but not more than one of each character
-Items are permanent (can be sold at a discount) and don't change when environments change. This discourages changing between categories.
-No level ceiling. Climb/push as far as your team can
-Currency - magic/resource that powers items humans are creating outside the biome, but need fuel to use them. Items get teleported in
	with enough of the resource.
